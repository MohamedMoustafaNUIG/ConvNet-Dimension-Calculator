# ConvNet-Dimension-Calculator
An application to calculate the output dimensions of a layer in a traditional convolution neural network given the input size and layer details

Still a work in progress

# Steps
1. Design a command line program for handling simple conv and pool layers
2. Design basic GUI for inputs
3. Improve GUI, work on error handling
